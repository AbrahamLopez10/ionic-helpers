# ionic-helpers
Premade Helpers (components, directives, providers, and pages) for Developing Ionic v2+ Applications

To install just clone this repository as a submodule (using "git submodule add [REPO_URL]") inside the src/ folder of your Ionic 2 application so you can keep track of updates, or just download the repo and copy it to the src/ folder of your project if you prefer to check for updates manually.

All helpers are customizable through class extension as well as through template overriding (using the @Component decorator) in the case of components and pages.

You can find ready-to-use examples in the examples/ folder of this repo as an individual folder for each example, to use them just copy the example's folder to the corresponding path in your project (e.g. src/pages/, src/providers/, etc.) and customize freely as you need.
